The used LLM tool: ChatGPT

Motivation/Reason to use LLM: 
- Using LLM is way faster to search for the needed information such as system-related information or commands, sometimes, for resolving bugs. It includes everything at one place

How and why LLM helped: 
- LLM provides information for different commands in different operating systems. Instead of searching one by one on Google, I can ask ChatGPT and receive the answers of the commands faster and in well structured format.
- LLM helps improve my writings 

What kinds of mistakes LLM did: 
- Failed to provide solutions when there is error connection between two services
- When I searched for the Docker base image, ChatGPT failed to return it correctly. So I went to the official .Net website to check for the images with SDK

What were things that LLM was not able to provide:
- Failed to provide solutions when there is error connection
- Failed to resolve the problem with missing 'ps'. I had to use console log to check for the OS name and found out the base image does not contain the 'ps' and researched the problem online

Prompt I used to fetch the list of commands: Please list commands for fetching IP address, running processes, available disk space, time since last reboot in different OS in C# .NET and in NodeJS
